As my ctrl+c and ctrl+v skills develops, I'm improving at choosing which snippet to copy. </p> <p> Thanks to my passion for web development and the opportunities I've had to develop applications on a professional level, I've been able to experience the stress and despair of the lovely impostor syndrome, due to short deadlines. That's why I've become quite proficient with Chat GPT and GitHub Copilot.</p> <p> I hope to keep being a web developer (without getting too many more grey hairs), and keep learning as many technologies as I can, which I don't think is too difficult to achieve, it's not like they were updated every month either... is it? </p>"
